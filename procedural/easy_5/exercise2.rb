# exercise2.rb - After Midnight (Part 1)

# The time of day can be represented as the number of minutes before or after
# midnight. If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight.
# If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

# Write a method that takes a time using this minute-based format and returns
# the time of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm). Your method should work with any
# integer input.

# You may not use ruby's Date and Time classes.

HOURS_PER_DAY = 24
MINUTES_PER_HOUR = 60
MINUTES_PER_DAY = MINUTES_PER_HOUR * HOURS_PER_DAY

def time_of_day(minutes_from_midnight)
  minutes_from_midnight = minutes_from_midnight % MINUTES_PER_DAY
  hours, minutes = minutes_from_midnight.divmod(MINUTES_PER_HOUR)
  format('%02d:%02d', hours, minutes)
end

# Examples:
p time_of_day(0) == "00:00"
p time_of_day(-3) == "23:57"
p time_of_day(35) == "00:35"
p time_of_day(-1437) == "00:03"
p time_of_day(3000) == "02:00"
p time_of_day(800) == "13:20"
p time_of_day(-4231) == "01:29"
# Disregard Daylight Savings and Standard Time and other complications.
