# exercise5.rb - Staggered Caps (Part 1)

# Write a method that takes a String as an argument, and returns a new
# String that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization
# scheme in which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining
# characters are lowercase. Characters that are not letters should not be
# changed, but count as characters when switching between upper and lowercase.

def staggered_case(str)
  new = ''
  index = 0
  while index < str.length
    index.even? ? new << str[index].upcase : new << str[index].downcase
    index += 1
  end
  new
end

# Example:
p staggered_case('I Love Launch School!') == 'I LoVe lAuNcH ScHoOl!'
p staggered_case('ALL_CAPS') == 'AlL_CaPs'
p staggered_case('ignore 77 the 444 numbers') == 'IgNoRe 77 ThE 444 NuMbErS'
